## D2RLoader support

On Windows, place `D2RLoader.exe` beside `D2R.exe` and select **Online** on the Launch page. The launcher starts D2RLoader directly with `-mod Reimagined -txt`; it does not route the Online experience through Battle.net. Use D2RLoader's TCP/IP option in-game to host or join.

The Launch page inventories extensions from both supported scopes without loading plugin DLLs:

- `<game>/d2rloader/plugins` and `<game>/d2rloader/patches`
- `<game>/mods/Reimagined/d2rloader/plugins` and `<game>/mods/Reimagined/d2rloader/patches`

The mod source remains the canonical Reimagined content source. D2RLoader compatibility assets can be packaged beneath the mod-local `d2rloader` folder when they are required; a separate copy of the full mod is not required.

## Ladder

A ladder launch is an Online (D2RLoader) launch with three extra guarantees: only the ladder's approved extensions are loaded, only clean Reimagined files are used, and **characters live on the Reimagined API rather than on the player's machine**.

It requires a signed-in D2R Reimagined website account. Without one the launch is blocked rather than silently falling back to local characters.

### Ladder characters have their own save folder

Ladder characters and a player's own Offline/Online characters are kept in physically separate directories. Before a ladder launch the launcher rewrites `savepath` in the mod's `modinfo.json`:

| Launch | Save folder under `Saved Games/Diablo II Resurrected/mods/` |
|---|---|
| Offline / Online | `ReimaginedThree/` |
| Ladder | `ReimaginedThree-<ladder-slug>-<ladder-id-prefix>/` |

For example, *Ben's Bitchin HC Ladder* becomes `ReimaginedThree-Bens-Bitchin-HC-Ladder-d630a3fc`. The id suffix keeps two ladders apart even if their names are similar, so a player can participate in several ladders at once without their characters colliding.

Because the folders are separate, **nothing is ever moved**. A player's own characters are never touched, hidden, or relocated, and switching back to Offline or Online just points the game at the original folder again. Removing the plugin, closing the launcher, or crashing mid-session cannot strand them.

Each ladder also gets its own shared stash, since `.d2i` lives in the save folder. Items cannot be moved between a ladder and offline play.

The launcher seeds a ladder folder with `Settings.json`, `lootfilter.json`, and any `*.fltr` loot filters from the normal Reimagined save folder when a destination file does not exist. Characters and the shared stash are deliberately not carried across. Existing files are never overwritten, so anything tuned inside a ladder is kept.

Every non-ladder launch restores the normal `savepath`, as does every ladder-launch failure path.

### The server-saves plugin

Server Saves comes from the signed ladder package and is installed into `mods/ReimaginedLadder/d2rloader/plugins/`. The launcher does not ship or install its own Server Saves DLL. Updating the launcher cannot change the ladder's plugin version.

The signed package and extension policy validate the installed files before launch. A missing Server Saves plugin blocks launch and requires repairing the ladder package. The launcher only writes its launch-time configuration.

### Who talks to the API

The launcher and the plugin both call the API, but never the same endpoints, and the plugin does **not** route its traffic through the launcher.

| | Calls | Never touches |
|---|---|---|
| Launcher | `/auth/launcher/*`, `/ladders/active`, ladder extension policy | `/characters/saves*` |
| `server-saves` plugin | `/characters/saves*` | anything auth-related |

The only thing they share is the access token: the launcher obtains and refreshes it, writes it into `d2rloader/config/server-saves.toml`, and the plugin uses it as a bearer token on its own requests. Once the game starts, the plugin is self-sufficient and the launcher can be closed.

### Order of operations

```
Launcher, before the game starts
  1. D2RLoader extensions   verify the signed ladder package, then apply the
                            ladder allowlist (unapproved/unchecked -> ladder-disabled/)
  2. Mod tweaks             restore clean Reimagined files, add the ladder banner
  3. Server saves           refresh the access token, write server-saves.toml,
                            redirect savepath and seed the ladder folder
  4. Backup                 if automatic backups are enabled
  5. Launch                 D2RLoader.exe -> D2R.exe

Plugin, inside the game process
  6. On load                pull the ladder's character manifest and reconcile the
                            folder against it, before the character screen is drawn
  7. During play            push each save, register new characters, forward deletes
  8. On exit                final push; park anything the server never accepted
```

Step 3 runs last on purpose. The save folder is only redirected once the plugin is confirmed installed, approved, and holding a valid token — otherwise a player would land in an empty folder where any character they created would never sync.

### Inside the ladder folder, the server is the authority

On each launch the plugin reconciles the ladder folder against the server's manifest. A character the server does not list is removed, and one whose bytes differ is replaced by the server's copy. If the API cannot be reached at all, the folder is emptied and the character screen is empty: no server, no characters.

Nothing is deleted outright. Anything displaced is copied into `.server-saves/backups/` first, and progress the server never accepted is parked in `.server-saves/pending-upload/` and re-offered on the next launch. Both live in a subfolder that D2R does not enumerate, so they are backups only and can never be loaded as characters.

## API configuration

The launcher uses `/ladders/schedule` for small, fresh schedule/live checks and
caches full client policies until their server-issued version changes. Deploy the
API with that endpoint before releasing this launcher. JSON responses support HTTP
compression. Schedule polling uses five minutes outside Ladder mode or without an
available ladder, 30 seconds for an available ladder, and shorter intervals near
its start. Entering Ladder mode and launching refresh immediately; cached policy
metadata never replaces current server authorization. Schedule/policy failures
block ladder readiness rather than reusing an old live confirmation.

### Ladder download recovery

Ladder package downloads persist under
`<D2R install>/.reimagined-launcher/ladder-bundles/downloads/`. The archive SHA-256
identifies each package: `<hash>.zip` holds the complete hash-verified archive and
`<hash>.zip.parts/` holds interrupted download chunks. Retrying, canceling and
reopening the launcher preserve partial progress. Completed chunks are reused;
incomplete chunks resume at their saved byte offsets when the server supports
HTTP ranges. Timeout and connection failures retry up to four attempts per chunk.
An expired storage URL is refreshed through the API on retry.

The initial range probe requests one byte. A server that ignores ranges instead
supplies a single full response; interrupted downloads from such a server must
restart. Unexpected ranges or sizes fail instead of installing incorrect bytes.
Every assembled archive must match the current API descriptor's hash, and every
installation still verifies the bundle signature and file contents. Corrupt
partial data is discarded for a fresh retry. A complete archive is saved before
verification/installation so later failures do not require another download.

Partial files are removed after the complete archive is saved. Archives and
unfinished downloads from older revisions are retained for reuse and consume disk
space; with the launcher closed, deleting this `downloads` folder clears only the
download cache (future repairs will download again). Do not delete the surrounding
ladder state or installed mod directories. This recovery applies to ladder bundle
packages, not the separate prerequisite installers or optional-file downloads.

Debug builds query the local Reimagined API at `http://localhost:5000/`. Other builds query `https://api.d2r-reimagined.com/`. Set `D2R_REIMAGINED_API_BASE_URL` to an absolute HTTP or HTTPS URL to override either default; for example, `$env:D2R_REIMAGINED_API_BASE_URL = "http://localhost:5000/"` in PowerShell before starting the launcher.

Launcher account sign-in opens the website in the system browser and returns through a random loopback port using a one-use PKCE authorization code. Debug builds open `http://localhost:9500/`; other builds open `https://www.d2r-reimagined.com/`. Set `D2R_REIMAGINED_WEBSITE_BASE_URL` to override the website origin during local integration testing.

Signed ladder packages also require the public half of the API's ECDSA signing key. Production builds can ship it as `Assets/LadderBundleSigningKeys/<key-id>.pem`. For local testing, point the launcher at the generated public PEM before starting it:

```powershell
$env:D2R_REIMAGINED_BUNDLE_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH = "C:\dev\d2r\reimagined-api\local-keys\local-development.pem"
```

The launcher rejects packages when the API descriptor, archive SHA-256, signed manifest, compatibility contract, declared file list, or installed file hashes differ. Schema-v2 packages manage the complete `mods/Reimagined` tree, including data JSON and TXT files; undeclared local files also block launch and are removed during repair. The private signing key must never be placed in this repository.
